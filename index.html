A eunuch was a man who was castrated so that we would not sexually assault a female aristocrat...this man probably had a lot of power, influence, and wealth, especially since he had been allowed to travel about 1500 miles to get to Jerusalem and was probably accompanied by a large caravan of travelers...what are three things we can guess about this man\'s character?')">eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of the Kandake (which means "queen of the Ethiopians").</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight1" onclick="askQuestion('6. What does this say about the Ethiopian\'s readiness to hear about Jesus?')">This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,</span> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot <span class="highlight2" onclick="askQuestion('7.

We don\'t know how long they traveled for, but what does this say about Philip\'s decision to keep talking to the man?')">As they traveled along the road</span>, they came to some water and the eunuch said, <span class="highlight1" onclick="askQuestion('24. We don\'t know if this man had heard of baptism before, but why do you think he initiated this?')">"Look, here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?"</span>

        <p>
            And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and <span class="highlight2" onclick="askQuestion('25. Why does Philip do this? Provide two reasons.')">Philip baptized him.</span>
